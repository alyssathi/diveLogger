# DiveLogger 2.0

An app to make logging your dives easier! Check out the live version here: Coming SoonüòÅ

## Before Development

### Initial Thoughts

I'm excited to start this project- it'll be interesting to see my improvements from DiveLog 1.0. I've planned much better this time around and took the time to learn Typescript concepts and some more Firebase concepts. I'm hoping this will make this project go a lot smoother than my [ReactChat](https://github.com/alyssathi/reactChat) app.

### Goals

I want to apply the concepts of two relatively new technologies to me (Typescript & Firestore) and learn through experience the best way to use them. I also want to learn from my ReactChat app and organize my app just a little bit better this time around.

### Tech Stack

- React: of course, it's the best
- Typescript: only my second time using it.
- Firestore: also only my second time using it.
- Component/UI Library: still working on it... MUI seems a bit heavy and hard to customize. Thinking about Chakra, Base or Blueprint.

### Planned Features

- Landing Page
- Email & Password Authentication
- Ability to add dive buddies to your account
- Search your own dives by certain constraints
- Add photos to Firestore
- Some form autofill options
